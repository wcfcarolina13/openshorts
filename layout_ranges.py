"""Which stretches of a rendered clip use which layout, kept next to the clip.

reframe_v2 decides a layout per scene (TRACK, GENERAL, SPLIT, ...) and renders
it, and nothing downstream used to know. Captions need to: on a SPLIT scene
the two speakers sit one above the other and the seam between the halves is
the emptiest place in the frame, so that is where the captions go (OpusClip
does the same). On every other layout they stay at the bottom.

The ranges travel as a sidecar ``<clip>.layout.json`` written by the render,
because the render happens in four different places (the job pipeline, the
recut/rerender, the manual reframe and the v1 fallback, which writes none)
and a return value would have to be threaded through all of them. Times are
in the CLIP's own timeline, which is also the timeline captions are laid on.
Whoever updates a clip's metadata copies them into ``layout_ranges`` so
/api/subtitle can find them after the sidecar is gone.
