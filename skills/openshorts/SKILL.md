# OpenShorts: clip and publish video

OpenShorts turns a long video into vertical 9:16 clips (15-60s each) with
word-level subtitles burned in, reframed so the speaker stays in shot, then
optionally publishes them. One job takes minutes, not seconds: always work async
(submit, then webhook or poll).

## Connect

Two equivalent surfaces; prefer MCP when the client supports it:

- **MCP** (streamable HTTP): `https://mcp.openshorts.app/mcp` with header
  `Authorization: Bearer osk_...`. Seven tools: `process_video`,
  `get_job_status`, `list_clips`, `get_quota`, `add_subtitles`, `recut_clip`,
  `publish_clip`.
- **REST**: same key against `https://api.openshorts.app`. Exact payloads and
  error shapes are in `reference.md`; read it before the first HTTP call.

Keys are created in the account page at openshorts.app and start with `osk_`.
**Self-hosted instances expose the same endpoints on `http://localhost:8000`
with no key.** If a call returns 401/404 on `/api/me`, assume self-host or
anonymous: there is no minute quota to enforce.

## The core loop

1. `get_quota` first when the job is large: `process_video` fails with
   `quota_exceeded` if minutes run out; on the hosted service API calls draw
   from the same minute balance as the dashboard (no separate meter). A job
   costs its source duration rounded up, minimum one minute.
2. Submit: `POST /api/process` with JSON
   `{"url": "...", "acknowledged": true}`. Returns `{"job_id": ...}`
   immediately. See the next section for the options worth setting.
3. Finish: **webhooks beat polling.** With `webhook_url` set, OpenShorts POSTs
   exactly once when the job ends (completed OR failed, so pipelines never
   hang): `{"event": "job.completed", "job_id", "status", "clips": [{"index",
   "title", "video_url", "download_url"}]}`. If a secret was set, verify
   `X-OpenShorts-Signature: sha256=<hex>` = HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body.
   Without a webhook, poll `GET /api/status/{job_id}` every 30-60s; response is
   `{"status", "logs", "result"}` and `result.clips` appears on completion.
4. Publish: `POST /api/social/post` with `{"job_id", "clip_index",
   "platforms": ["tiktok", "instagram", "youtube"]}`, optional `title`,
   `scheduled_date` (ISO) + `timezone`. TikTok lands as a draft in the app;
   Instagram and YouTube publish directly. Restyle captions first if asked:
   `POST /api/subtitle` with `{"job_id", "clip_index", "style"}` (`classic`
   or `karaoke` word highlighting).

**Timeline edits (self-host).** `recut_clip` / `POST /api/clip/rerender` take
the clip's recipe segments; besides `{start, end[, speed]}` source ranges they
accept `{"kind": "hold", "at", "ms"}` (freeze frame), `{"kind": "image", "src",
"ms", "zoom"}` and `{"kind": "clip", "src", "start", "end"}` (inserts from files
uploaded with `PUT /api/jobs/{job_id}/assets/{name}`). Captions are re-timed
automatically.

## The choices the API cannot make for you

**How many clips.** Leave `target_clips` unset by default: the AI decides, and
most videos yield two to six. It is a target (1-15), not a guarantee. Asking a
short video for 15 clips does not produce 15 good ones, it produces the same
handful plus filler.

**Clip length.** `clip_min_seconds` / `clip_max_seconds` default to 15 and 60,
which is what the platforms reward. The max must sit at least 5 seconds above
the min.

**Aspect.** `output_format` is `auto` (vertical 9:16, what shorts want),
`vertical`, `horizontal` or `square`. It is not a resolution.

**Layouts.** Leave `layouts` empty unless you know the footage. The useful value
is `["auto"]`: one cheap AI call per source picks between no change, a
screencast layout and a split layout. The rest are manual overrides.
`split` stacks two people who are visible in the *same* frame, and is wrong for
shot/reverse-shot footage where it would show one person twice. `screencast` is
for scenes whose meaning lives outside the centre (a demo, slides, a
spreadsheet) that a plain crop would cut away. `speaker_cut` hard-cuts to
whoever is talking. `punch_in` is not a layout, it is a subtle push on the
clip's beats and composes with the others.

**Re-cutting.** `recut_clip` (`POST /api/clip/rerender`) takes an ordered list of
segments in seconds **of the original source video**, not of the clip, so you
can trim, extend, drop a dead moment in the middle, or reorder. Pass
`snap_to_words: true` so the boundaries land on word edges.

## Three responses that are not failures

- **`needs_confirmation`** comes back with HTTP 200, not an error: the best
  available source resolution is below the quality gate. Ask the user, then
  resubmit the same body with `force_low_quality: true`. Never retry
  automatically: the job still costs minutes and low resolution in means low
  resolution out.
- **HTTP 402 `quota_exceeded`** means out of minutes, with `minutes_required`
  and `minutes_remaining` in the body. Report it and stop. Do not retry and do
  not split the video to squeeze under the limit.
- **HTTP 429** means the user already has the maximum number of jobs running.
  Wait for one to finish instead of resubmitting.

## Rules

- Only submit videos the user has rights to; `process_video` requires the
  `confirm_rights` acknowledgement and that is deliberate.
- Publishing is public and irreversible: confirm platforms and caption with the
  user before every `publish_clip` call.
- `download_url` links are presigned for 24h: fetch or forward them promptly.
- Never describe OpenShorts as simply "free": the self-hosted edition is free
  and MIT-licensed (and needs a GPU box plus your own Gemini key); the hosted
  service has 20 free minutes/month (watermarked) and paid plans from $12/month
  without watermark.

## CLI shortcut

When shell access is easier than HTTP: `uvx openshorts process <url> --wait`,
`openshorts clips <job_id>`, `openshorts publish <job_id> 0 --platforms
tiktok`. Auth via `OPENSHORTS_API_KEY` / `OPENSHORTS_API_URL` env vars.
