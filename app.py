# re-enqueued, at startup, the very jobs the old one was still rendering —
# and the old one had 30 s to live anyway. Now:
#   * every instance stamps OUTPUT_DIR/.instance with its id at startup; an
#     instance that sees another id there knows it is the OLD one and DRAINS:
#     it finishes what it is running, starts nothing new, and leaves queued
#     manifests for the new instance to pick up;
#   * a running job writes a heartbeat into its manifest every few seconds,
#     so the new instance skips manifests that are alive elsewhere and resumes
#     only the stale ones (an instance killed mid-job stops heartbeating);
#   * SIGTERM (docker stop) also drains, up to DRAIN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS — keep it
